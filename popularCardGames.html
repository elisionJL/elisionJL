            <img src="img/shadowverse.jpg" alt="shadowverse title screen">
            <p class="caption">A bit of a bias here but shadowverse is my personal favourite card game, it started off
                as a mobile game and has been ported to pc, there are more than 600 cards spread across 8 different classes each with their unique cards
                and mechanics which make it very fun to try new decks and the game can be played completely free
                although paying money will help. its fun to start out but has a deep learning curve.</p>
