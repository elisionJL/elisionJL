      <h2>Going global</h2>
      <div id="originGrid">
        <p> Cards were spread through out the world from the 11th to 14th century, starting in asia ,egypt then europe.
          It is speculated that the reason our modern day decks have 52 cards can be traced back to Persia and Arabia,
          which had decks consisted of 48 cards, representing numbers and courts grouped into suits much like modern
          cards, mamluk cards later increased it to 52 cards. a nearly complete set of mamluk cards were found in 1939
          in Istanbul, the deck contained 52 cards however cards that did not match the style of other cards were mixed
          in, speculations are that it was to make up for missing cards.
