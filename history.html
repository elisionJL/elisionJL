      <h2>The origins</h2>
      <div class="originGrid">
        <p> It is unclear when cards were truly invented as almost all evidence has been lost to time, however, it is
          widely accepted that it originated in china in the 9th century using woodblock printing technology. There were
          games revolving around drinking alchohol using a sort of
          card durign the tang dynasty, these "cards" did not have numbers or suits on them, instead it just had
          instructions and forfeits printed onto them

      <h2>Going global</h2>
      <div class="originGrid">
        <p> Cards were spread through out the world from the 11th to 14th century, starting in asia ,egypt then europe.
          It is speculated that the reason our modern day decks have 52 cards can be traced back to Persia and Arabia,
          which had decks consisted of 48 cards, representing numbers and courts grouped into suits much like modern
          cards, mamluk cards later increased it to 52 cards. a nearly complete set of mamluk cards were found in 1939
          in Istanbul, the deck contained 52 cards however cards that did not match the style of other cards were mixed
          in, speculations are that it was to make up for missing cards.

      <h2>modern iterations</h2>
      <div class="originGrid">
        <p> As technology improved, cards were cut to have rounded corners as they lasted longer, value of cards were
          printed at sides so that the holder can hold all the cards in one hand while still seeing all their values.
          The joker cards coomonly seen in modern day playing card decks were introduced in the united states after the
          American Revolutionary War to act as a wildcard. in the 18th century the Ace card was introduced and repalced
          the value of 1.
